<!--Here's a worked example of HTML and CSS from Lab 1!
	HTML consists of a hierarchy of elements.
	
	Each element has an opening tag and (most of the time) a closing tag.
	For example, the whole document is enclosed in the html element, delimited by the <html> and </html> tags.
	You can also close tags immediately using a slash before the > symbol: A newline is represented by <br />.

	Each tag can have attributes set as name="value" pairs.
	For example, the image element needs a source URL for the image file: <img src="dog.jpg" />
-->

<html>
<head>
	<!-- The title shows up in the browser toolbar -->
	<title>Dog's Homepage</title>
</head>

<body>
	<!--A header for the page-->
	<h1>Hello there</h1>

	<!--My photo-->
	<img id="photo" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/0684f90e7e5ac51a76307a83bd84a096/tumblr_obcgntstAf1r6vjaeo4_400.jpg">	

	<!--Divs and spans can be used to logically and structurally organize your page
		Here we use divs to separate different sections of the page: about, courses, interests and pet information
		* divs are block elements and are separated by newlines or breaks in the page
		* spans are inline elements and are displayed without newlines between them
	-->

	<!--Each div (and any other tag) can have a class and id.
		The class can be shared with other tags.
		The id is unique to this tag.
		The class and id can be selected by CSS rules to style groups of elements differently.
	-->
	<div class="section" id="">
		<!--An h2 header - smaller than the h1 header-->
		<h2>By Erik Olovsson</h2>

		<!--<p> tags are paragraphs have newlines before and after them-->
		<p>Hey!</p>
		<!--The <a> tag is a link.
			The text between the <a> and </a> tags is the displayed text.
			The href attribute has the link's target URL.-->
		<p>I hope you have a delightful dayâ€¦!</p>
